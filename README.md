# Corner-Grocer-project
The Corner Grocer app takes a list of items in inventory and counts how many times the item is on the list. This helps keep track of how many items the store has. In this application I relay the options of presenting the items to the user. The application reads the inventory in then outputs the item and quantity. I feel I could enhance the application by giving the user more instructions to the user to help use the program. Code doesnâ€™t come easy so the part I found challenging was using the map function. To help overcome this challenge, I use the C++ website to help learn how to use the function. Taking the time to test the code while writing it help me get a well writing code.
